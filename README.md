## Redux Toolkit
  - install @reduxjs/toolkit
  - create a store
  - connect our store to our application
  - create cart slice
  - dispatch an action
  - read data using selector

## Testing
Different types of testing 
- Manual Testing:  
- Writing the test cases 
  - **Unit Testing**: Testing a single react component in isolation. 
  - **Integration Testing**: Testing the integration of components.
  - **End to End Testing (e2e testing)**: Simulating what a user will do in the application. It required different types of tools like ***Cypress***, ***Puppeteer***, and ***Selenium***. These are all tools used for browser automation and testing. 

As a developer we are concerned majorly about the first two tesing, Unit Testing and Integration Testing.
